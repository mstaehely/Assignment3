PROJECT TITLE: Shapes
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is a homework assignment for a freshman-level programming course.
                    Please do not copy this code for your own solution!
                    
                    This application creates a user interface, allowing the user to select,
                    place, move, and change the color of a number of pre-determined shapes.
                    It is built using the MVC architecture. The components are as follows:
                    
                    MODEL
                    AbstractShape
                    Arrow
                    Circle
                    Cross
                    DrawingBoard
                    Shape
                    
                    VIEW
                    ShapeGraphicDisplay
                    ShapeTextDisplay
                    
                    CONTROLLER
                    GraphicsEditorApp
                    ShapeButtonListener
                    ShapeController
                    ShapeListener
                    ShapeMouseListener
                    
                    The main method is present in the GraphicsEditorApp, which is why I have
                    decided to consider it a 'controller'. This project acknowledges the
                    slight blurring of distinction between Controller and View created by the
                    use of listener classes as part of the Swing framework.
